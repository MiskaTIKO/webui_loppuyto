      <h2>Musikaalisia tuotoksia</h2>
      <p>
        Tässä on viime kesänä tekemäni Sound & Music for Games -opintojakson
        tuotokset. Kuvatekstit on otettu suoraan videoiden kuvauksista ja ovat
        siksi englanniksi.

            For this assignment I used Fruity Loops Studio. All of the sounds,
            including music were created with foley sounds. I recorded multiple
            different sounds, like knocking the package of my old CPU fan, heavy
            breathing, radio static, scraping two kitchen knives against each
            other, and the squeaking of my butterfly comb. After recording the
            samples, I used various filters and effects like bitcrush, ring,
            lo-fi, reverb, delay and some EQing as well. And yes, I also dubbed
            the parts with voice acting myself. This was such a fun assignment!
            It was interesting to figure out what kind of sounds could be used
            for different use cases. For example, for the part where Harry, the
            player character lights up a torch, I crumpled a small plastic bag
            into my fist and rubbed it with my other hand, after which I applied
            effects to make it sound nice. The sound didn't turn out to be
            exactly the way I wanted, but I think it still works really nicely.
            My main goal was not to make everything sound super realistic, but
            believable. I actually started the whole project with the "monster
            chase" track. I really wanted to emulate that Akira Yamaoka feel and
            turns out foley sounds were THE way to go. Again I want to reiterate
            that I did not use any instruments here. Only recorded and sampled
            sounds. It was really fun. <br />

            on the Sony Playstation. The gameplay footage is from MadOverdose's
            YouTube channel. I do not own the game, nor anything related to it.

            For this assignment I wanted to make a boss battle theme for Chrono
            Trigger. The idea for the melody actually came to me when I was
            taking a shower yesterday. It's not the first time I come up with
            someting cool while taking long refreshing shower, but this time I
            actually remembered to write the thing down in FL Studio. The
            original idea sounded very orchestral in my head, but I don't own
            any good orchestra VSTs, which is why I decided to go with
            soundfonts from several SNES and PSX games. The soundfonts used are
            from Chrono Trigger (surprise), Chrono Cross, MegaMan X, Seiken
            Densetsu 3 and Final Fantasy 7. The workflow was pretty
            straightforward. Not much to say, really. I played the original
            melody on piano, started adding chords that sound nice and then
            began building and adding to the track in FL Studio. It took some
            time to figure out what kinds of instruments I wanted to use. I'm
            not a professional, or even an amateur composer to be completely
            frank, so I think I did a pretty good job! A string like sound plays
            the main melody, very characteristic to JRPG battle themes. For the
            chords I went with a sound similar to a church organ, because it
            sounds very serious, holy and sinister. I also just REALLY love the
            organ as an instrument. I used a slap bass sound from the MegaMan X
            soundfont for the bassline to give the track some warmth and rhythm,
            which is accompanied by some simple drums and percussions. At around
            51 seconds is a little "break" from the more hectic part of the
            track. I'm not sure what the term for this part of the track would
            be. Please don't kill me! I cut the drums and bassline to make it a
            bit more peaceful. I added some heavenly bell sounds and took the
            melody and chord progression to more melancholic direction. Then the
            drums kick back in and the track starts over. I have a lot of song
            and soundtrack ideas, and I've started many projects, but I rarely
            sit my butt down and actually finish what I'm doing. I've never
            "finished" a track before. So in that regard this was a huge
            personal accomplishment for me. I grew up listening to video game
            music and I really want to compose stuff in the future. <br />

            First things first. I completely misread the instructions for this
            assignment and ended up making music for this scene instead of a
            soundscape. I'm so sorry. I spent the entire day soing this
            assignment and I really have to sleep before tomorrow's
            presentations, so I'll do a proper soundscape soon. Maybe during the
            weekend. But I also didn't want to completely discard today's work,
            so I'll upload this as it is. The song consists of one organ-like
            synth made with Native Instrument's Massive and two noise tracks,
            one being white noise and the other being "paper" noise from the
            Massive plugin. I also used a bit of reverb. At first I was going to
            go for drone, as the scene is quite slow and mysterious. I made a
            sine wave synth and applied a subtle LFO filter to give it some "wob
            wobs". It sounded good, but I ended up wanting something different.
            I wanted something a bit more "musical". Since the video footage
            doesn't change all that much, I decided to make the track somewhat
            repetitive, yet progressive, so that it doesn't get too boring. My
            first question was: "What emotions does this scene evoke in me?" To
            me it's kind of dark and sad, so i created a synth that sounds kind
            of like an organ and started with two chords. These two chords
            repeat throughout the song, with some variations here and there, as
            well as some melody too. As the camera keeps moving forward,
            progressing through whatever is submerged in the water, the song
            also progresses with it. The noise tracks kick in and the song
            evolves forward. As the camera approaches the hand of the person
            lying in the water, the white noise intensifies. And when the hand
            is finally in the center of the screen, the music loses all tension,
            like it's telling "this person is most likely dead." As the camera
            pans out, the high note dims away. Despite my misunderstanding the
            assignment, I'm quite happy about the way this track turned out to
            be. I've never made anything like this, so it was a joyous
            experiment. As I stated earlier, I'll return a properly done
            soundscape in the near future. <br />

            As a part of my Final Boss quest, I wanted to make a track for
            Armored Core. The creation of the track started of with simple drums
            and the acid synth arpeggio. I added a rhythmic bassline that has an
            analog feel to it. One of my favorite tracks from the series is
            "Circulation" from the first Armored Core game for the Playstation,
            so I in a way wanted to make my own version of it. The choir melody
            is more or less the same as in "Circulation", but played from a
            different key with a different tempo. For the choir I used a
            soundfont from Chrono Trigger. I downloaded a clip of some police
            radio chatter from freesound.org and added some reverb and tweaked
            the EQ to make it inaudible. I feel like I learned a bit more about
            mixing with this one. It's not perfect by any means, but I really
            like how it turned out. <br />

            Town themes in JRPGs are quite important, as the player often spends
            a lot of time in them, buying all kinds of items and equipment. I
            wasn't supposed to make a town theme initially, but after humming
            some funny tune in the shower a few weeks back, I couldn't resist
            the urge. The track has a total of 4 instruments: music box,
            pizzicato strings, regular strings, and panflute. Funnily enough,
            the panflute sounds almost like an organ when they play a chord. All
            of the instruments are from soundfonts from different games. The
            music box is from Final Fantasy V, the pizzcato from Trials of Mana,
            the panflute from Chrono Trigger and the regular strings are from FL
            Studio's own soundfont player. Despite this track being rather
            simple, it had quite a long development process. I really had to
            figure out what instruments go well with each other and the overall
            structure of the song had a couple of revisions. At first it was
            just the music box and pizzicato strings. I was stuck with them for
            a while, until I threw in the panflute and the strings followed. I
            think the track is very warm and joyful. I was going to record me
            running around in the city of Lindblum in Final Fantasy IX, but I
            stumpled upon this nice gif of one of the pre-rendered backgrounds.
            Out of all the towns and cities I know from JRPGs, Lindblum feels
            like the best fit. I had some difficulties with the mixing and for
            some reason the FL Soundfont Player screwed up the music box, it
            sounded muffled after exporting the audio file. But with some quick
            googling and patience, I found the TX16Wx Software Sampler and that
            fixed my music box issue. I had a ton of fun with the track. It was
            nice to do something I haven't ever tried before. <br />

            My original plan was to make three different tracks: some kind of a
            JRPG track, a sci-fi track and a horror track. I ended up discarding
            horror idea altogether and decided to expand on my previous Etude
            assignment, the boss battle track for Chrono Trigger. While I was
            happy with the original track I had created, I felt it was lacking
            something. I know there's no such thing as a "complete" piece of
            art, but still I felt like I could spark some magic to it if I
            wanted to. And I definitely wanted. I wanted to make the track sound
            more grandiose and epic. I replaced the slap bass with a timpani
            drum and added a rhythmic hihat to accompany the timpani. This
            change already gives the track a more traditional and organic battle
            theme feel. I also added a harp arpeggio, which makes the verse
            sound more full and exciting. The verse repeats two times before the
            chorus. On the second repeat, the strings start playing two-note
            chords and there's a subtle yet noticable deviation in the melody,
            which all add a bit of oomph to make the second repeat more
            exciting. The chorus (I think? I'm not entirely sure how song
            structure terms work in this kind of music.) now has a choir, which
            makes it sound rather heavenly and it definitely gives the chorus
            some much needed color. I had to adjust the panning of the bell
            sound make it stand out from all the other instruments. After the
            chorus, the drums return and the harp arpeggio plays for a while to
            sort of connect the track back to where it started. In terms of
            mixing, this was a really challeninging track. Not only did I want
            to mix the original instruments better, I now had to take the new
            instruments to consideration. Mixing is definitely more harder when
            there are multiple instruments playing, especially if they all play
            a chord of some sort. It can end up sounding very muddy, and we
            don't want that. The mixing here isn't perfect, but I don't think
            it's terrible either. I tried my best to separate the instruments
            with different panning positions. Mixing is still very tricky for
            me, but I think this little challenge here gave me some idea of how
            it should work. Out of all the assignments I've done during this
            course, I've spent the most hours with this one. It is my first,
            actually "complete" track and I plan to keep it close to my heart.
